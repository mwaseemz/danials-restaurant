git push -u origin client-customization

# Merge back to main when ready
git checkout main
git merge client-customization
```

### Commit Message Best Practices

git commit -m "Add: Online ordering section"
git commit -m "Fix: Mobile menu not closing properly"
git commit -m "Update: Pricing in proposal documents"
git commit -m "Improve: Hero section animations"
```

### Backup Strategy
- Push after significant changes
