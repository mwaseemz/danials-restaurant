Subject: Modernisering av danials.nu webbplats

Hej [Owner's name],

Jag heter Waseem Zaheer och är webbutvecklare. Jag har 
nyligen besökt danials.nu och sett en stor potential för 
modernisering som skulle kunna öka era online-beställningar 
avsevärt.

Jag har tagit fram en komplett, modern webbplats för er 
restaurang som är:
✓ Helt färdig och kan demonstreras nu
✓ 100% mobilvänlig
✓ Professionell design som matchar er kvalitet
✓ Klar att lansera inom 1 vecka

Jag skulle gärna visa er den och diskutera hur den kan öka 
era beställningar med 30-50%. Har ni 30 minuter för en 
snabb demonstration denna eller nästa vecka?

Bifogat hittar ni en kort sammanfattning.

Vänliga hälsningar,
Waseem Zaheer
